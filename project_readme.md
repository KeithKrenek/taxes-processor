## Quick Start

### Python Implementation
```python
from python.processor.pipeline import FinancialPipeline

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = FinancialPipeline(config_path="config/default.yaml")

# Process transactions
results = pipeline.process_file("data/sample/transactions.xlsx")

# Generate reports
pipeline.generate_reports(results, output_dir="data/output/")
```

### JavaScript Implementation
```javascript
import { FinancialProcessor } from './src/processor/main.js';

const processor = new FinancialProcessor();
const results = await processor.processFile('data/sample/transactions.xlsx');
console.log(results.summary);
```
